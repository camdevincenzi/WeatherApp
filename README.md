# WeatherApp

This project was made with vanilla JavaScript using the Open Weather API, 
you can write any city and when you press Enter a window pops up and shows its weather info,
or you can just click on "Get Device Geolocation" button and it will show the info based on your geolocation.
I added a function that changes the background too, depending on the city requested
